## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Bun installed ([bun.sh](https://bun.sh))
- A Neon PostgreSQL database (free tier available at [neon.tech](https://neon.tech))

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd pawn-tracker
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

3. Set up environment variables:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Edit `.env.local` and add your Neon database URL:

```env
DATABASE_URL=your_neon_database_url_here
```

4. Push the database schema:

```bash
bun run db:push
```

5. Seed the database with default investors:

```bash
bun run db:seed
```

6. Run the development server:

```bash
bun run dev
```

7. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Database Schema

The application uses the following main tables:

- **investors**: Store investor information
- **loans**: Store loan details
- **loan_investors**: Junction table linking loans and investors with allocation details
- **transactions**: Store investor transactions for balance tracking

## Available Scripts

- `bun run dev` - Start development server
- `bun run build` - Build for production
- `bun run start` - Start production server
- `bun run db:generate` - Generate database migrations
- `bun run db:migrate` - Run database migrations
- `bun run db:push` - Push schema changes to database
- `bun run db:studio` - Open Drizzle Studio (database GUI)
- `bun run db:seed` - Seed database with default investors

## Code Architecture & DRY Principles

This project follows **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** principles with a well-organized component architecture:

### Shared Utilities (`/lib/`)

- **format.ts**: Centralized formatting functions (currency, dates, percentages)
- **calculations.ts**: Business logic for loan calculations, investor stats, and aggregations
- **badge-config.ts**: Consistent badge styling across the app

### Reusable Components (`/components/common/`)

All common UI patterns are componentized (12 components):

- StatCard, EmptyState, PageHeader, ViewModeToggle, LoadingState
- SearchFilter, RangeFilter, FilterSection, CollapsibleSection
- Pagination, SortButton, InvestorTransactionCard

See `/components/common/README.md` for detailed documentation.

### Custom Hooks (`/hooks/`)

Encapsulated logic for common patterns:

- `usePagination`: Handle pagination state and logic
- `useSorting`: Handle sorting state and logic
- `useFilters`: Handle filtering state and logic

See `/hooks/README.md` for detailed documentation.

### Benefits

✅ **~500+ lines of duplicate code eliminated**  
✅ **Consistent formatting and calculations across the app**  
✅ **Easy to maintain and test**  
✅ **Type-safe with TypeScript**  
✅ **Composable and reusable**

See `REFACTORING_SUMMARY.md` for complete refactoring details.
